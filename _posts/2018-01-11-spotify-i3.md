Spotify has a good [Linux client](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/download/linux/). But it doesn't support [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/), so it is problematic to interact with Spotify using shortcuts or create a blocklet in i3 statusbar. Here I'd like to show how it could be achieved. At end we'll have following blocklet:

# Spotify CLI

First of all let's see how we can control Spotify from the command line. Luckily Spotify app supports MPRIS2 DBus [specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/Player_Interface.html), which basically means that you can send dbus messages to Spotify with actions, like play/pause, next, etc. To simplify this process here is the bash script which wraps it in handy functions: [gist.github.com/streetturtle/fa6258f3ff7b17747ee3](https://gist.github.com/streetturtle/fa6258f3ff7b17747ee3).

Let's install it:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://gist.github.com/fa6258f3ff7b17747ee3.git
cd ./fa6258f3ff7b17747ee3
chmod +x
sudo ln -s ./sp /usr/local/bin/
{% endhighlight %}

Test it by running `sp help`.

# i3 shortcuts

With `sp` installed it's pretty simple to create keyboard shortcut, I'm using following combinations:

 - `mod`{:.key}+`.`{:.key} - next track
 - `mod`{:.key}+`,`{:.key} - previous
 - `mod`{:.key}+`/`{:.key} - play/pause

Add following snipped to your i3 config:

>~/.config/i3/config
{:.filename}
{% highlight config %}
...
bindsym $mod+greater exec "sp next"
bindsym $mod+less exec "sp prev"
bindsym $mod+slash exec "sp play"
...
{% endhighlight %}

# i3 blocklet

Here is also nothing special. `sp` has two methods which is used in this blocklet - `sp current-oneline` to get the current artist and song name and `sp status` which tells if music is currently playing or not. This blocklet also supports mouse controls. Please note that you will need to install Font Awesome to have a play/pause icon.

Create spotify_blocklet file under **~/.config/i3/** with following content:

>~/.config/i3/spotify_blocklet
{:.filename}
{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

case $BLOCK_BUTTON in
    1) sp play ;; # left click
    4) sp next ;; # scroll up
    5) sp prev ;; # scroll down
esac

if sp status | grep 'Paused' > /dev/null; then
    printf '\xef\x81\x8c ' # fa-pause
else
    printf '\xef\x81\x8b ' # fa-play
fi
sp current-oneline
{% endhighlight %}

Make it executable (`chmod +x ./spotify_blocklet`) and test it by executing. Finally in .i3blocks.conf add blocklet definition:

{% highlight conf %}

[spotify]
command=$HOME/.config/i3/spotify_blocklet
interval=1
color=#74AEAB
{% endhighlight %}
